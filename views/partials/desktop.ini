; This file appears to be a desktop.ini file, used by the Windows operating system
; to store folder-specific settings, such as customized icons, display names,
; or tooltips. It's not executable code but rather configuration data for Windows Explorer.

; The [ShellClassInfo] section typically defines how the folder should be treated
; or displayed by the Windows shell (Explorer).
[.ShellClassInfo]
; LocalizedResourceName specifies a resource (often a string in a DLL or the .ini file itself)
; that Windows Explorer should use as the display name for this folder.
; Here, "@partials,0" likely attempts to reference a resource named 'partials'
; (perhaps intending to display the folder name as "partials"), but the syntax might be
; specific to a localization method or could be interpreted differently depending on context.
; The ",0" usually refers to the index of the string within the resource.
LocalizedResourceName=@partials,0

; The [LocalizedFileNames] section allows providing localized (display) names
; for specific files within this folder, overriding their actual filenames in Explorer.
[LocalizedFileNames]
; Each line maps an actual filename (left of '=') to its localized display name resource (right of '=').
; Similar to LocalizedResourceName, "@_header.ejs,0" suggests that the file "_header.ejs"
; should be displayed using a localized resource named "_header.ejs" (index 0).
; This pattern repeats for the other .ejs files listed.
; This is often used to make filenames more user-friendly or to translate them without
; actually renaming the files on the disk, which could break application references.
_header.ejs=@_header.ejs,0
_issue_form.ejs=@_issue_form.ejs,0
_issues.ejs=@_issues.ejs,0
_project_form.ejs=@_project_form.ejs,0

; In summary: This desktop.ini file configures the Windows Explorer display settings
; for the folder it resides in (presumably named 'partials'). It attempts to set a
; localized display name for the folder itself and potentially for the EJS partial files
; within it, although the effectiveness depends on how these resource strings (@...)
; are resolved by the system or specific tools. For typical web development workflows,
; this file usually has no impact on how the application code (Node.js, EJS templates)
; functions. It's primarily a Windows Explorer cosmetic feature.
